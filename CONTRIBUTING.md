## Getting Started: Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up your machine for development.

### 1\. Install Node.js

You need **Node.js** (version 22 LTS or higher). Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it already.

### 2\. Set Up Python Environment

We use Python for various development scripts and tools.

1.  **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.13 or higher installed. You can check your version with `python --version`.

2.  **(Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment**: This isolates project dependencies and keeps your global Python installation clean.

      * **Windows:**
        ```powershell
        python -m venv .venv
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**: Install all required Python packages for development and pre-commit checks.

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

4.  **(Optional) Install Documentation Dependencies**: If you plan to work on the documentation, install the docs-related packages.

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
    ```

### 3\. Set Up dprint for Code Formatting

We use [dprint](https://dprint.dev/) for consistent code formatting.

  * **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://dprint.dev/install.sh | sh
    ```
  * **Windows:**
    Download the installer from the [dprint releases page](https://github.com/dprint/dprint/releases) and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.

### 4\. Set Up Pre-Commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run code quality checks before each commit. This helps catch issues like inconsistent line endings, trailing whitespace, and large files.

1.  **Install the hooks**: Once Python dependencies are installed, run this command in the repository root to activate the hooks.
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```
2.  **Verify installation**: You can run all checks manually on all files to ensure everything is working.
    ```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

Now, the checks will run automatically every time you commit\!

## Local Development Workflow

Hereâ€™s how to run the different parts of the project locally.

### Running the Main Site (Eleventy)

This project uses [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) as the static site generator.

  * **To start the development server with live reload:**
    Any changes you make will automatically rebuild the site and reload your browser.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
  * **To build the static site for production:**
    This generates the final files in the output directory without starting a server.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

### Building the Documentation (Sphinx)

Run the following commands from the repository root to build the Sphinx documentation:

```shell
cd doc
make html
```

The generated HTML files will be in the `doc/build/html` folder.

### Cloudflare Workers Development

To work with the Cloudflare Workers site located in `packages/cfsite`:

  * **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    cd packages/cfsite
    npx wrangler dev
    ```
  * **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    cd packages/cfsite
    npm run test
    ```

### Docker Development (Optional)

You can use Docker to run pre-commit checks in an isolated environment.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t my-go-precommit .
    ```
2.  **Run checks inside the container:**
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app my-go-precommit
    ```

## How to Contribute

Ready to make a change? Follow this process.

### Step 1: Create an Issue

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please **create an issue** first.

  * **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
  * Provide a clear title and a detailed description. For bugs, include steps to reproduce.

### Step 2: Fork and Clone the Repository

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brisbanesocialchess.github.io.git
    cd brisbanesocialchess.github.io
    ```

### Step 3: Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes with a descriptive name.

```bash
git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

Now, you can edit code, add features, or fix bugs.

### Step 5: Run Pre-Submission Checks

Before committing, ensure your changes meet our quality standards by running the following commands:

1.  **Format your code:**
    ```bash
    npm run format
    dprint fmt --allow-no-files
    ```
2.  **Run all pre-commit hooks:**
    This command runs linters (ESLint, markdownlint, yamllint) and other checks to ensure consistency.
    ```bash
    python -m pre_commit run --all-files
    ```

### Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes

1.  **Commit** your changes with a clear, descriptive message.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add a cool new feature"
    ```
2.  **Push** your branch to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-descriptive-branch-name
    ```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1.  Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2.  Click the **"Compare & pull request"** button.
3.  Write a clear title and description for your pull request. If it resolves an existing issue, link it using `Fixes #issue-number`.
4.  Click **"Create pull request"** and wait for feedback from the maintainers.
