## Getting Started: Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up your machine for development.

### 1. Install Node.js

You need Node.js (version 20 LTS or higher). Download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if you don't have it already.

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

We use Python for various development scripts and tools.

**Install Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.12 or higher installed. You can check your version with `python --version`.

**(Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment:** This isolates project dependencies and keeps your global Python installation clean.

**Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Install Dependencies:** Install all required Python packages for development and pre-commit checks.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**(Optional) Install Documentation Dependencies:** If you plan to work on the documentation, install the docs-related packages.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
```

### 3. Set Up dprint for Code Formatting

We use dprint for consistent code formatting across JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and Markdown files.

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dprint.dev/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:** Download the installer from the [dprint releases page](https://github.com/dprint/dprint/releases) and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.

### 4. Set Up Pre-Commit Hooks

We use pre-commit to automatically run code quality checks before each commit. This helps catch issues like inconsistent line endings, trailing whitespace, and large files.

**Install the hooks:** Once Python dependencies are installed, run this command in the repository root to activate the hooks.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

**Verify installation:** You can run all checks manually on all files to ensure everything is working.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Now, the checks will run automatically every time you commit!

## Local Development Workflow

Here's how to run the different parts of the project locally.

### Running the Main Site (Eleventy)

This project uses Eleventy (11ty) as the static site generator.

**To start the development server with live reload:** Any changes you make will automatically rebuild the site and reload your browser.

```bash
npm run start
```

**To build the static site for production:** This generates the final files in the output directory without starting a server.

```bash
npm run build
```

### Building the Documentation (Sphinx)

Run the following commands from the repository root to build the Sphinx documentation:

```bash
cd doc
make html
```

The generated HTML files will be in the `doc/build/html` folder.

### Cloudflare Workers Development

To work with the Cloudflare Workers site located in `packages/cfsite`:

**Start the development server:**

```bash
cd packages/cfsite
npx wrangler dev
```

**Run tests:**

```bash
cd packages/cfsite
npm run test
```

### Docker Development (Optional)

You can use Docker to run pre-commit checks in an isolated environment.

**Build the Docker image:**

```bash
docker build -t asc-precommit .
```

**Run checks inside the container:**

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app asc-precommit
```

## How to Contribute

Ready to make a change? Follow this process.

### Step 1: Create an Issue

If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please create an issue first.

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Provide a clear title and a detailed description. For bugs, include steps to reproduce.

### Step 2: Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brisbanesocialchess.github.io.git
cd brisbanesocialchess.github.io
```

### Step 3: Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes with a descriptive name.

```bash
git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name
```

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

Now, you can edit code, add features, or fix bugs.

### Step 5: Run Pre-Submission Checks

Before committing, ensure your changes meet our quality standards by running the following command:

**Run all pre-commit hooks:** This command runs dprint for formatting, linters (ESLint, markdownlint, yamllint), and other checks to ensure consistency.

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Note:** The pre-commit hooks automatically run dprint for code formatting, so you don't need to run `dprint fmt` separately. If you want to format files manually before committing, you can run:

```bash
dprint fmt
```

### Step 6: Commit and Push Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add a cool new feature"
```

Push your branch to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin your-descriptive-branch-name
```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
3. Write a clear title and description for your pull request. If it resolves an existing issue, link it using `Fixes #issue-number`.
4. Click "Create pull request" and wait for feedback from the maintainers.

## Community Support

If you need help or have questions, please:

- **Join Discussions:** Participate in ongoing discussions in the issues or project forums.
- **Contact Maintainers:** Reach out to project maintainers if you need direct assistance.
