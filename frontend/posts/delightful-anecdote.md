A Visit to Simpson’s Chess Divan. During a visit to London in 2014, after seeking out 221 B, Baker Street (the address of the detective Sherlock Holmes), my partner and I chanced to walk past Simpson’s Chess Divan in the Strand, which is adjacent to the Savoy Hotel. At first impression it appeared to be an exclusive establishment (possibly “members only”), but we were, to our pleasant surprise, welcomed by the Doorman.

We subsequently strolled through an entrance hall adorned with Chess memorabilia including a board used by Steinitz. Simpson’s has been host to many of the greats of the golden era of chess, including Steinitz, Bird, Blackburne, Morphy, Zukertort and Lasker; names that have featured in many compilations of chess puzzles. We proceeded upstairs to partake of an excellent afternoon tea, in very salubrious surroundings. Espresso Coffee was served in demi-tasses that were elegantly emblazoned with the Simpson’s logo (see below).

Demonstrating my plebeian proclivities and the mentality of a trophy-hunting tourist, (or a latter-day “Bazza” Mackenzie ?), I naïvely asked the fastidiously garbed waiter if I could purchase such a cup as a souvenir. The waiter was aghast at the suggestion. “No, sorry Sir, we don’t do that”. Suitably embarrassed, I returned to masticating my macaroons, imbibing the (excellent) coffee, soaking up the fin-de siècle ambience, and hoping to be possessed by the spirits of the great chess players that presumably haunted the place.

A few minutes later, the waiter re-appeared, carrying a small package wrapped in newspaper. He gave it to me. To my great delight, when I opened the package, a Simpson’s cup and saucer were revealed! “Class” of a bygone age; the age of mythical chess, and patrician manners.

Needless to say, on departure, I left a good-sized gratuity.

To end, I leave you with Bird versus Steinitz, at Simpson’s Divan, 1866.
