    Calling all Blunderers! Join Brisbane's coolest chess crew every Saturday morning as we transform West End Park Café into checkered board central.<br/>
    Arrive anytime from 1030 AM to soak up the cafe's scrumptious breakfast menu, piping hot coffee, and morning newspapers. Early risers, late sleepers, and every bird in between is welcome!<br/>
    Gentlemen - a change for 2025:
    <strong>Coffee and service will be available from 10:30 to approximately 1pm - but then Sunny advises me that the kitchen will close and all food and drink will be BYO from 1pm.</strong><br/>
    Our excellent host, Brisbane's most chess friendly café owner, stocks up on chess sets so you can just show up and play. Still, you are encouraged to bring your favourite set (and timer if you use one). Let your chess history shine through your unique chess gear!
    And be sure to take advantage of the cafe's menu. You'll notice the fresh flavours and stellar value. As always, please lend struggling opponents a helping rook or bishop! Go easy with extra time, sly hints, and do-overs to keep things fun. We're all about friendly games and good spirit.
    Dreaming up new chess adventures? We wanna hear them! Open to ideas for new venues and times to spread the social chess joy.
    Chess experts and newbies alike - every level is welcome in our club. We know you've got talent waiting to be discovered over a chess board!<br/>
    Easy parking and a nearby bus stop make West End Park Café an accessible location for all. And the famous West End Markets are steps away for browsing before or after chess.<br/>
    So grab your thinking cap and join our Saturday morning ritual as we make boredom checkmate together!
