[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is a fast, modern build system for managing and publishing multiple JavaScript/TypeScript packages from the same repository.
Experiment with Lerna and bootup a local developer playground from the repository root with: `npx lerna run dev`.

## Cloudflare Workers Development

To work with the Cloudflare Workers site in the `packages/cfsite` directory:

### Start Development Server

```bash
cd packages/cfsite
npx wrangler dev
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd packages/cfsite
npm run test

## Getting Started / Building the Site

```

---

## Build the Docker image for running `pre-commit` easily

```bash
docker build -t my-go-precommit .
or
docker build --no-cache -t my-go-precommit .
```

And then:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app my-go-precommit
```

Or if you want to run and keep the container and go into bash:

```bash
docker run -it -v "$PWD":/app -w /app my-go-precommit bash
```
